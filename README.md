ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Artem Pichugin. I become a merchant ship officer, because I was afraid of Maths. But my passion is IT. Since I switched off my father's old PC,
I have been interested in everything about IT. Sitting in front of screen, typing hundreds line of code, puzzling over, trying 
to find a bug and finally find solution. For me sounds like fun! So it is not job, it is my hobbie, a way to express myself and maybe change the world. 



ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT technologies, escpecially in Data Science, Blockchain, Game Development,

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Python, Data Science', 'Solidity', 'algorithms', 'Computer Science by Harvard CS50']
